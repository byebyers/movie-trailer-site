Hello!

So in this project I was supposed to make a movie site using Udacity's code called fresh_tomatoes. In order to run the code you would need to open entertainment_center.py but the code is written in byers_movie_site.py which includes the original code from fresh_tomatoes. The biggest change I made was to move the CSS code to a separate file so I could focus styling the web page in a separate window however it is referenced correctly in byers_movie_site.py so it can run. 

If your wondering where entertainment_center places the movie data correctly you can see that python file imports media frome the same folder. In the file media.py shows the layout of the movie info.
